# Git & Github Notes

This is a repo of my notes taken during Colt Steele's Git & Github Bootcamp, will be revising later, adding separate HTML pages for sections, and in general cleaning up the notes once I'm finished. For now I'm focused on just writing notes in my HTML file

For reference this is a good link to creating visually appealing README markdown files:
