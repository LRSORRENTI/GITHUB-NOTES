# Git & Github Notes

This is a repo of my notes taken during Colt Steele's Git & Github Bootcamp, I will be revising later, adding separate HTML pages for sections, or maybe some sort of dropdown selector or nav bar to navigate to specific sections, and in general cleaning up the notes once I'm finished.

As for now I'm just focused on just writing the best notes I can in my HTML file

For reference this is a good link to creating visually appealing README markdown files:
